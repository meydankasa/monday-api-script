# moveoMondayApp


This app takes the information from the Sprint-board(members & hours)
Sums up each employee with his on working hours(like the personal fillter bord - hours SUM)
and finally pushes the hours strake to Info-board, every member to his hours.

And also sends emails at the end of each day to all team leaders,
with the hours of employees on their staff

Worning!!!
The script is searcing and push by the Memeber Name, So boat boards Member Name should be similar.


Start commend: 'npm run dev'"# mondayApi" 
"# monday-api-script"
